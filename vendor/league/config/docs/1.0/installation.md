# Installation

The recommended installation method is via Composer.

```bash
composer require "league/config:^1.0"
```

Ensure that youâ€™ve set up your project to [autoload Composer-installed packages](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading).

## Versioning

[SemVer](http://semver.org/) will be followed closely.  **It's highly recommended that you use [Composer's caret operator](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md#caret-version-range-) to ensure compatibility**; for example: `^1.0`.  This is equivalent to `>=1.0 <2.0`.
