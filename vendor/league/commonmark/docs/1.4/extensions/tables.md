# Table Extension

_(Note: this extension is included by default within [the GFM extension](/1.4/extensions/github-flavored-markdown/))_

The `TableExtension` adds the ability to create tables in CommonMark documents.

## Installation

This extension is bundled with `league/commonmark`. This library can be installed via Composer:

```bash
composer require league/commonmark
```

See the [installation](/1.4/installation/) section for more details.

## Usage

Configure your `Environment` as usual and simply add the `TableExtension` provided by this package:

```php
use League\CommonMark\CommonMarkConverter;
use League\CommonMark\Environment;
use League\CommonMark\Extension\Table\TableExtension;

// Obtain a pre-configured Environment with all the CommonMark parsers/renderers ready-to-go
$environment = Environment::createCommonMarkEnvironment();

// Add this extension
$environment->addExtension(new TableExtension());

// Instantiate the converter engine and start converting some Markdown!
$converter = new CommonMarkConverter($config, $environment);
echo $converter->convertToHtml('Some Markdown with a table in it');
```

## Syntax

This package is fully compatible with [GFM-style tables](https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-):

### Simple

Code:

```markdown
th | th(center) | th(right)
---|:----------:|----------:
td | td         | td
```

Result:

```html
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">th</th>
<th align="center">th(center)</th>
<th align="right">th(right)/th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">td</td>
<td align="center">td</td>
<td align="right">td</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
```

### Advanced

```markdown
| header 1 | header 2 | header 2 |
| :------- | :------: | -------: |
| cell 1.1 | cell 1.2 | cell 1.3 |
| cell 2.1 | cell 2.2 | cell 2.3 |
```

## Credits

The Table functionality was originally built by [Martin Haso≈à](https://github.com/hason) and [Webuni s.r.o.](https://www.webuni.cz) before it was merged into the core parser.
