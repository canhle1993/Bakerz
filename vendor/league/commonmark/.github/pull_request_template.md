<!-- Please read our contributing guide before opening a new PR: https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md -->

<!--
Replace this section with a short README for your feature/bugfix. This will help people understand your PR.

Additionally:
 - Always add tests and ensure they pass.
 - Avoid breaking backward compatibility
 - Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply
   (lowest branches will be merged to upper ones so they get the fixes too.)
 - New features and deprecations must be submitted against the "main" branch
-->
