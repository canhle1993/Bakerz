# Description List Spec

Based on <https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#def-list>

-----

Description lists are made of terms and descriptions of these terms, much like in a dictionary.

A simple description list is made of a single-line term followed by a colon and the description for that term.

```````````````````````````````` example
Apple
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in
    the family Rosaceae.

Orange
:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.
.
<dl>
<dt>Apple</dt>
<dd>Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in
the family Rosaceae.</dd>
<dt>Orange</dt>
<dd>The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.</dd>
</dl>
````````````````````````````````

Terms must be separated from the previous description by a blank line.
Descriptions can span on multiple lines, in which case they should be indented.
But you donâ€™t really have to: if you want to be lazy, you could forget to indent a description that span on multiple lines and it will still work:

```````````````````````````````` example
Apple
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in
the family Rosaceae.

Orange
:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.
.
<dl>
<dt>Apple</dt>
<dd>Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in
the family Rosaceae.</dd>
<dt>Orange</dt>
<dd>The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.</dd>
</dl>
````````````````````````````````

Colons as description markers typically start at the left margin, but may be indented by up to three spaces:

```````````````````````````````` example
No Spaces
: Okay

One Space
 : Okay

Two Spaces
  : Okay

Three Spaces
   : Okay

Four Spaces
    : NOT OKAY
.
<dl>
<dt>No Spaces</dt>
<dd>Okay</dd>
<dt>One Space</dt>
<dd>Okay</dd>
<dt>Two Spaces</dt>
<dd>Okay</dd>
<dt>Three Spaces</dt>
<dd>Okay</dd>
</dl>
<p>Four Spaces
: NOT OKAY</p>
````````````````````````````````

The number of spaces can vary between consecutive descriptions, so long as they don't exceed three spaces of indentation.

```````````````````````````````` example
No Spaces
: Okay (0)
 : Okay (1)
  : Okay (2)
   : Okay (3)
    : NOT OKAY

One Space
 : Okay (1)
: Okay (0)
 : Okay (1)
  : Okay (2)
   : Okay (3)
    : NOT OKAY

Two Spaces
  : Okay (2)
 : Okay (1)
: Okay (0)
 : Okay (1)
  : Okay (2)
   : Okay (3)
    : NOT OKAY

Three Spaces
   : Okay (3)
  : Okay (2)
 : Okay (1)
: Okay (0)
 : Okay (2)
  : Okay (3)
   : Okay (4)
    : NOT OKAY

Four Spaces
    : NOT OKAY
   : Okay (3)
  : Okay (2)
 : Okay (1)
: Okay (0)
 : Okay (1)
  : Okay (2)
   : Okay (3)
    : NOT OKAY
.
<dl>
<dt>No Spaces</dt>
<dd>Okay (0)</dd>
<dd>Okay (1)</dd>
<dd>Okay (2)</dd>
<dd>Okay (3)
: NOT OKAY</dd>
<dt>One Space</dt>
<dd>Okay (1)</dd>
<dd>Okay (0)</dd>
<dd>Okay (1)</dd>
<dd>Okay (2)</dd>
<dd>Okay (3)
: NOT OKAY</dd>
<dt>Two Spaces</dt>
<dd>Okay (2)</dd>
<dd>Okay (1)</dd>
<dd>Okay (0)</dd>
<dd>Okay (1)</dd>
<dd>Okay (2)</dd>
<dd>Okay (3)
: NOT OKAY</dd>
<dt>Three Spaces</dt>
<dd>Okay (3)</dd>
<dd>Okay (2)</dd>
<dd>Okay (1)</dd>
<dd>Okay (0)</dd>
<dd>Okay (2)</dd>
<dd>Okay (3)</dd>
<dd>Okay (4)
: NOT OKAY</dd>
<dt>Four Spaces</dt>
<dt>: NOT OKAY</dt>
<dd>Okay (3)</dd>
<dd>Okay (2)</dd>
<dd>Okay (1)</dd>
<dd>Okay (0)</dd>
<dd>Okay (1)</dd>
<dd>Okay (2)</dd>
<dd>Okay (3)
: NOT OKAY</dd>
</dl>
````````````````````````````````

Description markers must be the first non-space character on a line:

```````````````````````````````` example
Not Valid
Because: there are other characters before the `:` on this line
.
<p>Not Valid
Because: there are other characters before the <code>:</code> on this line</p>
````````````````````````````````

Description markers must be followed by one or more spaces or a tab:

```````````````````````````````` example
Not Valid
:because there's no space or tab after the `:`
.
<p>Not Valid
:because there's no space or tab after the <code>:</code></p>
````````````````````````````````

Description lists can have more than one description associated with one term:

```````````````````````````````` example
Apple
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in
    the family Rosaceae.
:   An American computer company.

Orange
:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.
.
<dl>
<dt>Apple</dt>
<dd>Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in
the family Rosaceae.</dd>
<dd>An American computer company.</dd>
<dt>Orange</dt>
<dd>The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.</dd>
</dl>
````````````````````````````````

You can also associate more than one term to a description:

```````````````````````````````` example
Term 1
Term 2
:   Description a

Term 3
:   Description b
.
<dl>
<dt>Term 1</dt>
<dt>Term 2</dt>
<dd>Description a</dd>
<dt>Term 3</dt>
<dd>Description b</dd>
</dl>
````````````````````````````````

If a description is preceded by a blank line, the description will be wrapped in `<p>` tags in the HTML output:

```````````````````````````````` example
Apple

:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in
    the family Rosaceae.

Orange
:    The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.
.
<dl>
<dt>Apple</dt>
<dd><p>Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in
the family Rosaceae.</p></dd>
<dt>Orange</dt>
<dd>The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.</dd>
</dl>
````````````````````````````````

When multiple descriptions are given, the tightness of each can vary based on whether there's a blank line preceding each one:

```````````````````````````````` example
Apple
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in
    the family Rosaceae.

:   An American computer company.

Orange

:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.
:   The color between yellow and red on the spectrum of visible light.
.
<dl>
<dt>Apple</dt>
<dd>Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in
the family Rosaceae.</dd>
<dd><p>An American computer company.</p></dd>
<dt>Orange</dt>
<dd><p>The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.</p></dd>
<dd>The color between yellow and red on the spectrum of visible light.</dd>
</dl>
````````````````````````````````

Multiple terms for a single definition must not be separated by spaces:

```````````````````````````````` example
This is a term
This is also a term
: Description goes here

This is a term
This is also a term

: Description goes here

This is a paragraph

This is a term

: Description goes here
.
<dl>
<dt>This is a term</dt>
<dt>This is also a term</dt>
<dd>Description goes here</dd>
<dt>This is a term</dt>
<dt>This is also a term</dt>
<dd><p>Description goes here</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<dl>
<dt>This is a term</dt>
<dd><p>Description goes here</p></dd>
</dl>
````````````````````````````````

Just like regular list items, descriptions can contain multiple paragraphs, and include other block-level elements such as blockquotes, code blocks, lists, and even other description lists.

```````````````````````````````` example
Term 1

:   This is a description with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum
    dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam
    hendrerit mi posuere lectus.

    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet
    vitae, risus.

:   Second description for term 1, also wrapped in a paragraph
    because of the blank line preceding it.

Term 2

:   This description has a code block, a blockquote, two lists, and a short paragraph.

        code block.

    > block quote
    > on two lines.

    1.  first list item
    2.  second list item

    Nested Term
      : A nested definition

    A short paragraph.
.
<dl>
<dt>Term 1</dt>
<dd><p>This is a description with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum
dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam
hendrerit mi posuere lectus.</p>
<p>Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet
vitae, risus.</p></dd>
<dd><p>Second description for term 1, also wrapped in a paragraph
because of the blank line preceding it.</p></dd>
<dt>Term 2</dt>
<dd><p>This description has a code block, a blockquote, two lists, and a short paragraph.</p>
<pre><code>code block.
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>block quote
on two lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>first list item</li>
<li>second list item</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>Nested Term</dt>
<dd>A nested definition</dd>
</dl>
<p>A short paragraph.</p></dd>
</dl>
````````````````````````````````

And terms can contain inline-level elements, like emphasis and links:

```````````````````````````````` example
The **Big Apple**

: Another name for New York City

[Orange County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California)

:    The third-most populous county in California; home to Disneyland
.
<dl>
<dt>The <strong>Big Apple</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Another name for New York City</p></dd>
<dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California">Orange County</a></dt>
<dd><p>The third-most populous county in California; home to Disneyland</p></dd>
</dl>
````````````````````````````````

Description lists will not be parsed if no preceding terms exist. Note that terms cannot contain block elements.

```````````````````````````````` example
: No terms before this one

# This is a heading, not a term
: So this doesn't count either
.
<p>: No terms before this one</p>
<h1>This is a heading, not a term</h1>
<p>: So this doesn't count either</p>
````````````````````````````````

Descriptions cannot be blank:

```````````````````````````````` example
The description below is blank

:

We treat that as a paragraph
.
<p>The description below is blank</p>
<p>:</p>
<p>We treat that as a paragraph</p>
````````````````````````````````
