## Code style

Please make your code look like the other code in the project.

PsySH follows [PSR-12](http://php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/). This is automatically managed by [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/), so you don't need to worry about a thing!

## Running tests

1. Run `make test` to run tests!

## Building pre-compiled phars

1. Run `make build` to build everything, or `make build/psysh/psysh` for just the default build.
2. Copy `build/psysh/psysh` somewhere useful like `/usr/local/bin`.
3. Profit!
